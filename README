This is the place I publish my work during my MRes.
I improved the randomisation method in stimuli choosing (See the rmd. file) from the SOLID database (Frank, D., Gray, O., & Montaldi, D. (2020). SOLID-Similar object and lure image database. Behavior Research Methods, 52(1), 151-161.). The stimuli-choosing process is based on standardised similarity index between stimuli. To control for similarity, we set a fixed low similarity of 1000 and a high similarity level of 2000 between targets and foils and named them high similarity and low similarity lures. I made this procedure completely transparent by picking out all the potential triplets (targets, high similarity foils, low similarity foils) first and randomly choosing one from each category. Then, I put all the selected stimuli in folders. We also needed to make sure that three items in a triplet were not placed too close to each other in the retrieval session. Therefore, I wrote code to shuffle the stimuli list based on this criterion. I also made it possible to generate multiple lists depending on the number of participants so we could randomise the order for each participant.
